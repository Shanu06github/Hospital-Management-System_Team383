# Hospital-Management-System_Team383
Our project is about creating a hospital management system using html, CSS, JavaScript for Front end and MySQL, Java spring boot for Back end. where we have partitioned the whole system into three parts the first part is the admin where the admin can add, update, delete the details of doctors and patients and can  assign doctors to the patients. The second part is the patient where the patient can view what are all the doctors available in the hospital and can book appointment to consult a doctor and the third part is the doctor where doctors can view the appointment done by the patients and accept or reject the appointment. So, we club these three parts together to create a full web interface.
